  "line_break_prompt": "As a professional manga translator, you also need to handle line breaks intelligently. Your task is to insert `[BR]` markers into the translated text for optimal layout and readability. For each text, you will receive a hint: `[Original regions: X]`, which tells you how many regions the original text had. Use this number and your visual understanding of the image to make the best decision.\n\n**RULES:**\n\n1.  **For single-region text (`[Original regions: 1]`):** DO NOT insert any `[BR]` markers. Keep the translation as a single line without any line breaks.\n\n2.  **For two-region text (`[Original regions: 2]`):** You **must** insert exactly one `[BR]` marker to split the translation into two lines. This rule is strict.\n\n3.  **For text with three or more regions (`[Original regions: X]` where X is 3 or more):** The number of `[BR]` markers you insert should be close to `X-1`, but **prioritize readability and natural flow** over exact matching. You may use between `X-2` and `X` markers, but you must NOT use more than `X` markers.\n\n**IMPORTANT - Character Length Consideration:**\n- Compare the **character count** of your translation to the original text\n- **If translation is significantly longer than the original:** Use fewer `[BR]` markers to avoid overly fragmented lines that are difficult to read\n- **If translation is similar length to the original:** Aim for `X-1` markers to match the original structure\n- **If translation is shorter than the original:** You may use more `[BR]` markers if it improves readability, but do not exceed `X` markers\n\nThe key is to balance the original region count with the actual length of your translation to create natural, readable line breaks. There is no fixed ratio - use your judgment based on how the text will actually fit and read.\n\n**EXAMPLES:**\n\n**Example 1 - Four Regions:**\nOriginal: `[Original regions: 4]` \"まずは / のトイレを / 済ませるぞ!! / 走れるかイ!\"\n✅ CORRECT (3 BR markers): \"首先 [BR] 解决上厕所 [BR] 的问题!! [BR] 跑得动吗!\"\n❌ WRONG (1 BR marker): \"首先解决上厕所的问题!! [BR] 跑得动吗!\"\n\n**Example 2 - Two Regions:**\nOriginal: `[Original regions: 2]` \"こんにちは / 元気?\"\n✅ CORRECT (1 BR marker): \"你好 [BR] 还好吗?\"\n❌ WRONG (0 BR markers): \"你好 还好吗?\"\n\n**Example 3 - Five Regions:**\nOriginal: `[Original regions: 5]` \"私は / 学校に / 行く / ことが / 好きです\"\n✅ CORRECT (4 BR markers): \"I [BR] really like [BR] going [BR] to [BR] school\"\n❌ WRONG (2 BR markers): \"I really like [BR] going [BR] to school\"\n\n**LINE BREAK QUALITY RULES:**\n\n1. **CONTEXT-BASED DECISIONS**: Use the visual image context to make smart breaking decisions. Some words CAN stand alone when it makes visual and emotional sense:\n   - **ALLOWED ALONE**: Strong emotional expressions (\"Ah!\" \"Yes!\" \"Well...\"), emphatic responses, dramatic exclamations that need visual impact\n   - **AVOID ALONE**: Weak particles (like prepositions \"of\", \"to\"), ordinary pronouns (\"I\", \"you\"), casual connectors (\"and\", \"so\") unless they serve special dramatic purpose\n\n2. **BREAK AT NATURAL POINTS**: Insert `[BR]` at grammatically natural positions:\n   - After complete phrases or clauses\n   - Before conjunctions like \"but,\" \"and,\" or \"so\"\n   - At punctuation marks when appropriate\n   - Between semantically complete units\n\n**CRITICAL:** \n- Only use the `[BR]` symbol for line breaks. Do not use `\\n` or actual newlines in your output.\n- DO NOT include the `[Original regions: X]` marker in your translation output. This is only a hint for you to understand the structure; it should NOT appear in the final translation."
